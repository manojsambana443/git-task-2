- Linked my local repository to GitHub
- Pushed changes to a remote repository
- Created and worked with branches
- Merged branches into main
- Practiced rollback using Git commands

---

## What I Learned
This task helped me understand how developers manage code changes over time. I learned how Git keeps track of every change and how GitHub helps store and share code remotely.

---

## Challenges
Understanding branching and rollback commands was confusing at first, but practicing them made things clearer.

## Outcome
After completing this task, I now understand the real-world workflow of version control and feel confident using Git and GitHub for managing projects.
